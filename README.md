# Vertica on Pure Storage Example

This repository is for various code examples related to running Vertica databases on Pure Storage. The examples may be used as-is, or may be adapted for individual environments and scenarios.

There are two main subsections:

1. Vertica PoC (`vertica-poc`) — code for quickly building out Vertica PoC environments for demos and tests. Primarily consists of Ansible playbooks and some setup bash scripts.
2. Vertica Cloning (`vertica-cloning`) — example Ansible playbooks with code related to cloning Vertica databases for Test/Dev and DR validation scenarios.

See the detailed README file within each subsection for how to use the code.
