# To Do

## Refactoring
1.  Split the `all.yml` in the `group_vars` into smaller chunks aligned with specific roles.
2. Incorporate the `outposts-ephemeral.sh` script into the Ansible playbook when the nodes have ephemeral instance storage available. 

## Prep Script
1.  Convert as much of the prep script as possible to Ansible and ensure idempotency for setup.
