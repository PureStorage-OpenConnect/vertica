# To Do

## Refactoring
1.  Split the `all.yml` in the `group_vars` into smaller chunks aligned with specific roles.

## Prep Script
1.  Validate that the separate private and public interfaces work as expected in AWS environments.
2.  Convert as much of the prep script as possible to Ansible and ensure idempotency for setup.
